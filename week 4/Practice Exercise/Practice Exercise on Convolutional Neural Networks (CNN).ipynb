    "# Practice Exercise on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Practice Exercise on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this exercise, we will focus on an image classification task where the goal is to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog. We will work with a dataset of labeled images and build, train, and evaluate a CNN model. This practice will allow you to apply your understanding of CNNs to achieve high accuracy in image classification.\n",

    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Name:** Cats and Dogs Image Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description:**  \n",
    "The dataset contains images of cats and dogs labeled for classification purposes. Each image belongs to one of the two classes: 'Cat' or 'Dog'. The goal is to classify the images correctly based on the content (i.e., whether the image is of a cat or a dog). The dataset is often used to test image classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features:**\n",
    "There are two main folders which are:\n",
    "- `Cat`: Images labeled as containing a cat.\n",
    "- `Dog`: Images labeled as containing a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Target Variable:**\n",
    "- The goal is to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.\n"
